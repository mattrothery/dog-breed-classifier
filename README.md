# A Google Colab implementation of a dog breed classifier, using TensorFlow and Inception v3

This colab notebook uses the Stanford Dogs dataset: http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/

The dataset consists of 120 dog breeds, with ~150 images per class, for a total of 20,580 images.

The computer vision model, Inception v3 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567), is finetuned and evaluated on this dog dataset. 

Using this colab notebook, you can tweak hyperparameters, finetune and train a model, export/save the model and even upload unseen dog images to test the models performance!
